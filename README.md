Like assignment 2, this assignment also focuses on graph algorithms and representing them graphically. 
We chose to plot our graph by creating a GUI using the pyGame library.
Our program can load and save a graph, find the shorest path between two nodes, find the shortest path that visits all the nodes in a given list, and find the center of the graph. 

More information about each class and function can be found in this assignment's wiki.
