Like assignment 2 (OOP_DWG_algorithms), this assignment also focuses on graph algorithms and representing them graphically. The program consists of  classes NodeData, EdgeData, and Point3D in order to create the nodes and edges of the graph. The program also consists of classes DiGraph and GraphAlgo which implement the GraphInterface and GraphAlgoInterface respectively. 
The graph can be plotted by the creation of a GUI using the pyGame library.
Our program can load and save a graph, find the shorest path between two nodes, find the shortest path that visits all the nodes in a given list, and find the center of the graph.

In addition a graph can be presented in a simple user-friendly GUI that allows you to run any of the capabilities mentioned above, and also make changes to the graph like adding or removing nodes and edges.
To run the GUI with a graph, download this repository and run the following command line code from your shell at the folder of the downloaded repository:

$ python3 RunGUI.py _JSON_GRAPH_FILE_PATH_


More information about each class and function can be found in this assignment's wiki.
