Like assignment 2, this assignment also focuses on graph algorithms and representing them graphically. The program consists of  classes NodeData, EdgeData, and Point3D in order to create the nodes and edges of the graph. The porgram also consists of classes DiGraph and GraphAlgo which implement the GraphInterface and GraphAlgoInterface respectively. 
The graph can be plotted by the creation of a GUI using the pyGame library.
Our program can load and save a graph, find the shorest path between two nodes, find the shortest path that visits all the nodes in a given list, and find the center of the graph. 

More information about each class and function can be found in this assignment's wiki.
